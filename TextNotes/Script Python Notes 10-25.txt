: = {} colons are braces. EVERYTHING IN AN IF/FOR/WHILE statement MUST BE INDENTED THE SAME AMOUNT. 4 spaces is the norm. I.e. if(blahblahblah):
No longer need to put colons at the end of lines
no longer need to write out string, int, etc. Can simply assign a number or string or whatever to a variable.
by default the python engine is in Maya, but you have to call it.

import maya.cmds.ls basically means you're going to refer to maya.cmds as ls for the rest of the code.
bools must be capitalized. "True".

import maya.cmds as cmds

sels = cmds.ls(sl = True)

for sel in sels:
        cmds.connectAttr('Snake_IK_Spline_Jnt_Scale_MD.outputX', '%s.translateX' % sel, f=True)
