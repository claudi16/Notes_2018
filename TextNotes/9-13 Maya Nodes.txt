Connection Editor
Windows -> general Editors -> connection editor
or Channel Box -> Edit -> connection editor
each attribute is a type (i.e. variable, int, string, etc.) 
therefore you cannot connect 2 different types together. (there
are some exceptions though. Like string to int)

options -> attribute order -> alphabetical (helpful)
select output on the left side, and select whatever you want to associate
it to on the right side. You're limited to your output but NOT your input

Output (something going into a node). Input (what you get out of it)

Node Editor
Window -> node editor
Output -> In Mesh
the reverse node is good for IK/FK switches. As long as you're
outputting into the same you inputted, it should work
Drover -> direct connection to FK and also to a reverse node
Hotkeys 123 to open nodes
